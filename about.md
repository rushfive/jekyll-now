My name's **Isaiah Lee** and I'm a full stack software developer based in Seattle, WA. Currently working for the platform team at [DatStat](http://www.datstat.com/).

I'm a husband and father to three fantastic kids. If I ever get free time for dev stuff on the side, I'm typically working with .NET, python, and react.
